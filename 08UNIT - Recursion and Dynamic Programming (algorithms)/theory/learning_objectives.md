## Overview

This document specifies the learning objectives for Unit 08 of the Computational Thinking for Researchers curriculum. Objectives are organised by cognitive level and mapped to specific assessments.

## Cognitive Objectives

### Level: Apply

| ID | Objective | Assessment Method |
|----|-----------|-------------------|
| LO1 | Implement recursive solutions with appropriate base cases and recursive decomposition for tree traversal, mathematical sequences and divide-and-conquer algorithms | Lab 08.01 |
| LO3 | Transform naive recursive solutions into memoised versions using dictionary-based caching and functools.lru_cache | Lab 08.01 |
| LO4 | Construct bottom-up dynamic programming solutions with appropriate table initialisation and state transitions | Lab 08.02 |

### Level: Analyse

| ID | Objective | Assessment Method |
|----|-----------|-------------------|
| LO2 | Derive recurrence relations from recursive algorithms and solve them to determine time and space complexity | Quiz Q1-Q4 |
| LO5 | Compare memoisation and tabulation approaches, identifying conditions favouring each strategy | Homework P2 |

### Level: Evaluate

| ID | Objective | Assessment Method |
|----|-----------|-------------------|
| LO6 | Select and justify the optimal algorithmic approach (recursive, memoised, tabulated, space-optimised) for given problem constraints | Quiz Q8-Q10 |
