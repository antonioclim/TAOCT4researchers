[*] --> UNF : Raw data

UNF --> 1NF : Eliminate\nrepeating groups
note right of 1NF
    Split multi-valued
    attributes into rows
end note

1NF --> 2NF : Remove partial\nkey dependencies
note right of 2NF
    Every non-key attribute
    depends on whole key
end note

2NF --> 3NF : Remove transitive\ndependencies
note right of 3NF
    Non-key attributes depend
    only on primary key
end note

3NF --> [*] : Normalised\nschema
