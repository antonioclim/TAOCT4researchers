## 🔍 Common Mistakes Checklist

Review these common errors before submission:

### Design Mistakes
- [ ] Using rainbow/jet colourmap (use viridis or Wong palette)

- [ ] Missing axis labels or units
- [ ] Legend covering data
- [ ] Incorrect aspect ratio
- [ ] Font too small for print

### Technical Mistakes
- [ ] Not setting random seed for reproducibility
- [ ] Hardcoded file paths
- [ ] Missing type hints
- [ ] No docstrings
- [ ] Using plt.show() in scripts (use plt.savefig())
- [ ] Not closing figures (memory leak)

### D3.js Mistakes
- [ ] Not using .join() for enter-update-exit
- [ ] Forgetting to set viewBox for responsiveness
- [ ] Scales with wrong domain/range
- [ ] Missing axis tick formatting
