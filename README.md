## Part I: Introduction and Overview

## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Mission Statement

This repository constitutes the primary educational resource accompanying *The Art of Computational Thinking for Researchers*, a thorough textbook designed to cultivate computational fluency amongst academic researchers across disciplinary boundaries. The materials herein represent a carefully orchestrated pedagogical intervention addressing a critical gap in contemporary research training: the systematic development of algorithmic reasoning capabilities that transcend mere programming proficiency.

The curriculum spans fourteen interconnected units, each addressing a distinct facet of computational thinking whilst maintaining rigorous attention to theoretical foundations and practical applicability. From the epistemological underpinnings of computation itself through advanced concerns of parallel processing and machine learning, the materials guide learners through a carefully scaffolded progression that respects both the intellectual depth of the subject matter and the time constraints facing working researchers.

### 1.2 Educational Objectives

The overarching educational objectives of this curriculum may be articulated across three dimensions:

**Cognitive Development**

Participants completing this curriculum will demonstrate mastery of:

- Formal models of computation including Turing machines and lambda calculus
- Design patterns and architectural principles enabling maintainable software construction
- Asymptotic analysis and empirical performance characterisation techniques
- Graph-theoretic and probabilistic data structures addressing real-world scale
- Numerical methods for simulation including Monte Carlo integration and ODE solvers
- Visual communication principles and publication-quality figure generation
- Testing frameworks and continuous integration pipelines ensuring reproducibility
- Recursive problem decomposition and dynamic programming strategies
- Exception handling approaches and defensive programming methodologies
- Data persistence mechanisms from file systems to relational databases
- Text processing pipelines and natural language processing fundamentals
- Web API consumption and ethical data acquisition practices
- Machine learning workflows from preprocessing to model evaluation
- Parallel and distributed computing approaches for computational scalability

**Metacognitive Awareness**

Beyond technical competencies, learners develop heightened awareness of:

- The relationship between formal theory and practical implementation
- Trade-offs inherent in algorithmic and architectural decisions
- The epistemological status of computational results
- The social and ethical dimensions of computational research

**Professional Preparation**

Graduates of this curriculum emerge prepared to:

- Construct research software meeting contemporary quality standards
- Collaborate effectively in computational research teams
- Contribute to open science initiatives with appropriate technical sophistication
- Evaluate and critique computational claims in peer-reviewed literature

### 1.3 Distinctive Features

Several characteristics distinguish this curriculum from alternative approaches to computational education:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Research Orientation** | All examples and exercises derive from authentic research contexts spanning natural sciences, social sciences and humanities |
| **Theoretical Grounding** | Practical skills rest upon firm theoretical foundations, ensuring transferability beyond specific tools or languages |
| **Progressive Scaffolding** | Materials follow a carefully designed sequence respecting cognitive load constraints and prerequisite dependencies |
| **Multi-Modal Assessment** | Learning outcomes are verified through diverse assessment modalities including automated testing, peer review and reflective writing |
| **Reproducibility Emphasis** | Contemporary concerns regarding computational reproducibility permeate all units, culminating in dedicated treatment |
| **Interactive Elements** | HTML-based visualisations and animations support conceptual understanding of abstract computational processes |
| **Extended Coverage** | Fourteen units provide complete treatment from foundations through advanced topics in ML and parallel computing |

### 1.4 Scope and Delimitations

This curriculum addresses computational thinking as a cognitive framework applicable across research domains; it does not constitute a computer science degree programme nor a full introduction to any specific programming language. Python serves as the implementation vehicle throughout, selected for its readability, extensive scientific libraries and widespread adoption in research contexts. However, the principles and patterns addressed transfer readily to other languages and environments.

The materials assume basic Python competency equivalent to a single introductory course or self-directed study programme. Researchers lacking this foundation may wish to consult preparatory resources enumerated in [Section 32](#32-further-reading) before engaging with the primary curriculum.

## 2. Philosophical Foundations

### 2.1 Computational Thinking as a Cognitive Framework

The concept of computational thinking, as articulated by Jeannette Wing and subsequently elaborated by numerous scholars, represents a distinctive mode of reasoning that extends far beyond the mechanics of programming. Computational thinking involves the capacity to recognise problems amenable to algorithmic solution, to decompose complex challenges into tractable subproblems and to reason abstractly about computational processes without recourse to specific implementation details.

This curriculum adopts a constructivist epistemology, recognising that genuine understanding emerges through active engagement with challenging material rather than passive reception of transmitted knowledge. Laboratory exercises therefore assume central importance, providing the experiential substrate upon which theoretical understanding crystallises.

### 2.2 The Research Context

Contemporary research increasingly depends upon computational methods, yet formal training in computational thinking remains unevenly distributed across disciplines. Researchers in traditionally quantitative fields may receive substantial programming instruction but limited exposure to software engineering principles or formal computational theory. Those in qualitative traditions may encounter computational methods only peripherally, despite the growing relevance of computational approaches to their domains.

This curriculum addresses this heterogeneity by assuming minimal prior computational background whilst rapidly progressing to advanced topics. The research orientation of all examples ensures relevance to participants regardless of disciplinary origin, whilst the emphasis on transferable principles prepares learners for the inevitable technological evolution they will encounter over their careers.

### 2.3 Pedagogical Commitments

The instructional design reflects several foundational commitments:

**Mastery over Coverage** — The curriculum prioritises deep understanding of fundamental principles over superficial exposure to many topics. Each unit allocates substantial time for deliberate practice, ensuring that competencies become genuinely habitual rather than merely nominally acquired.

**Active Learning** — Passive consumption of lectures and readings cannot produce the cognitive restructuring required for genuine computational fluency. Laboratory exercises, practice problems and reflective assessments structure active engagement with the material.

**Formative Feedback** — Automated testing provides immediate feedback on laboratory implementations, whilst self-assessment instruments encourage metacognitive reflection. This rapid feedback cycle accelerates learning whilst building self-regulatory capacities.

**Authentic Context** — All examples and exercises derive from genuine research scenarios, ensuring that participants recognise the relevance of skills to their professional aspirations.

## 6. UNIT 02: Abstraction and Encapsulation

<div align="center">

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Position** | 2 of 14 |
| **Difficulty** | ★★★☆☆ (Intermediate) |
| **Duration** | 8 hours |
| **Prerequisites** | UNIT 01 |
| **Keywords** | SOLID principles, Design patterns, Protocols, Type systems |

</div>

### 6.1 Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this unit, participants will:

- Apply SOLID principles to structure maintainable research software
- Implement behavioural design patterns (Strategy, Observer, Factory, State)
- Utilise Python protocols for structural subtyping
- Design plugin architectures enabling runtime extension
- Construct dependency injection frameworks for flexible configuration

### 6.2 The SOLID Principles

| Principle | Statement | Research Application |
|-----------|-----------|---------------------|
| **Single Responsibility** | A class should have one reason to change | Separate data loading from analysis from visualisation |
| **Open-Closed** | Open for extension, closed for modification | Plugin architectures for new analysis methods |
| **Liskov Substitution** | Subtypes must be substitutable for base types | Interchangeable solvers with common interface |
| **Interface Segregation** | Prefer specific interfaces to general ones | Separate interfaces for reading versus writing |
| **Dependency Inversion** | Depend on abstractions, not concretions | Pass interfaces rather than concrete implementations |

### 6.3 Design Pattern Visualisation

Each unit operates independently with its own Makefile:

```bash
cd "01UNIT - The Epistemology of Computation (foundations)"

# Install unit-specific dependencies
make install

# Run all tests
make test

# Run laboratories
make lab

# View slides
make slides

# Clean generated files
make clean
```

### 22.2 Testing Protocol

```bash
# Run tests for a specific unit
cd "XXUNIT - Title (keyword)"
pytest tests/ -v

# Run tests with coverage
pytest tests/ --cov=lab --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_lab_XX_01.py -v
```

## 26. Running Laboratories and Tests

### 26.1 Laboratory Execution

Laboratories are designed for guided implementation. Each laboratory file contains:

- Docstrings explaining the task
- Function stubs with type hints
- Embedded test cases for self-verification

```python
# Example: Running a laboratory interactively
cd "04UNIT - Advanced Data Structures (design)/lab"
python

>>> from lab_04_01_graph_library import Graph
>>> g = Graph()
>>> g.add_edge('A', 'B')
>>> g.bfs('A')
['A', 'B']
```

### 26.2 Automated Testing

```bash
# Run all tests for current unit
pytest tests/ -v

# Run with detailed output
pytest tests/ -v --tb=long

# Run specific test class
pytest tests/test_lab_04_01.py::TestGraph -v

# Generate coverage report
pytest tests/ --cov=lab --cov-report=term-missing
```

## 31. Troubleshooting Guide

### 31.1 Common Installation Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| `ModuleNotFoundError` | Verify virtual environment is activated; reinstall requirements |
| Version conflicts | Create fresh virtual environment; use `pip install --upgrade` |
| Permission errors | Use `--user` flag or fix directory permissions |
| Import errors in tests | Run from unit root directory; verify `__init__.py` files exist |

### 31.2 Test Failures

```bash
# If tests fail unexpectedly:

# 1. Verify correct directory
pwd  # Should be in unit root

# 2. Check Python path
python -c "import sys; print(sys.path)"

# 3. Run with verbose output
pytest tests/ -v --tb=long

# 4. Run single test for isolation
pytest tests/test_lab_XX_01.py::test_specific_function -v
```
