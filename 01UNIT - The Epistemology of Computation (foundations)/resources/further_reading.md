# Week 1: Further Reading

## The Epistemology of Computation

This curated list provides resources for deeper exploration of computation theory.

## Essential Reading

### 1. Turing's Original Paper

**Turing, A. M. (1936).** "On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem." *Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society*, 42(2), 230-265.

*The foundational paper that started it all. Turing introduces his "a-machines" and proves the undecidability of the Halting Problem. Surprisingly readable for an 88-year-old mathematics paper.*

🔗 [Available online via Cambridge University Press]

---

### 2. Introduction to the Theory of Computation

**Sipser, M. (2012).** *Introduction to the Theory of Computation* (3rd ed.). Cengage Learning.

*The standard textbook for computation theory. Chapters 3-4 cover Turing machines; Chapter 5 covers undecidability. Clear explanations with excellent exercises. Highly recommended for rigorous understanding.*

📚 ISBN: 978-1133187790

---

### 3. Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs

**Abelson, H., & Sussman, G. J. (1996).** *Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs* (2nd ed.). MIT Press.

*The legendary "wizard book" from MIT. Builds an interpreter step-by-step, explaining evaluation, environments and recursion. Essential for understanding how programming languages work.*

## Lambda Calculus Deep Dive

### 4. An Introduction to Lambda Calculi for Computer Scientists

**Hankin, C. (2004).** *An Introduction to Lambda Calculi for Computer Scientists*. King's College London.

*A gentler introduction to lambda calculus than Barendregt's handbook. Covers Church encodings, combinatory logic and connections to functional programming.*

📚 ISBN: 978-1904987031

---

### 5. Types and Programming Languages

**Pierce, B. C. (2002).** *Types and Programming Languages*. MIT Press.

*The definitive text on type theory. Chapters 5-6 provide excellent coverage of lambda calculus. The book then extends to typed lambda calculi, which underpin modern programming languages.*

📚 ISBN: 978-0262162098

---

## Historical and Philosophical Context

### 6. Gödel, Escher, Bach

**Hofstadter, D. R. (1979).** *Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid*. Basic Books.

*A Pulitzer Prize-winning exploration of self-reference, recursion and consciousness. Discusses Gödel's incompleteness theorems and their implications through creative dialogues and examples.*

📚 ISBN: 978-0465026562

---

### 7. The Annotated Turing

**Petzold, C. (2008).** *The Annotated Turing: A Guided Tour Through Alan Turing's Historic Paper on Computability and the Turing Machine*. Wiley.

*A line-by-line annotation of Turing's original paper. Petzold provides historical context and explains the mathematics in accessible terms. Excellent for truly understanding Turing's contribution.*

📚 ISBN: 978-0470229057

---

## Practical Applications

### 8. Crafting Interpreters

**Nystrom, R. (2021).** *Crafting Interpreters*. Genever Benning.

*A hands-on guide to building two complete interpreters. Covers lexing, parsing, evaluation and bytecode compilation. Available free online with excellent visualisations.*

---

### 9. Writing an Interpreter in Go

**Ball, T. (2018).** *Writing an Interpreter in Go*. Thorsten Ball.

*A practical, code-focused approach to building an interpreter. Though in Go, the concepts translate directly to Python. Good for hands-on learners.*

📚 ISBN: 978-3982016115

---

## Research Applications

### 10. Biological Sequence Analysis

**Durbin, R., Eddy, S., Krogh, A., & Mitchison, G. (1998).** *Biological Sequence Analysis: Probabilistic Models of Proteins and Nucleic Acids*. Cambridge University Press.

*Shows how finite automata and hidden Markov models apply to bioinformatics. Chapter 3 covers profile HMMs for sequence alignment.*

📚 ISBN: 978-0521629713

---

### 11. Speech and Language Processing

**Jurafsky, D., & Martin, J. H. (2023).** *Speech and Language Processing* (3rd ed. draft).

*The standard NLP textbook. Chapters 2-3 cover regular expressions and finite automata in linguistic context. Chapter 12 covers parsing algorithms.*

🔗 [Free draft at web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3]

---

### 12. A New Kind of Science

**Wolfram, S. (2002).** *A New Kind of Science*. Wolfram Media.

*Controversial but fascinating exploration of cellular automata as computational models. Relevant to physics, biology and complex systems research.*
