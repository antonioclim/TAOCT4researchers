# Datasets for Week 1 Exercises

This directory contains datasets for practice exercises.

## Contents

Currently, Week 1 does not require external datasets as the exercises focus on:

- Turing machine traces (generated programmatically)
- Lambda calculus expressions (symbolic)
- AST construction (from source code strings)

## Future Additions

If you need sample data for extended exercises, consider:

- `sample_programs.txt` — Source code snippets for parsing
- `tm_definitions.json` — Pre-defined Turing machine specifications
- `lambda_expressions.txt` — Lambda calculus expressions for reduction practice
