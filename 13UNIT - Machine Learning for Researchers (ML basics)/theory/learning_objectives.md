## Measurable outcomes

Given a labelled dataset, students can construct a supervised learning pipeline that avoids leakage by fitting preprocessing transformations on training data only and then evaluating on a held-out test set.

Given a set of candidate estimators, students can justify a model choice by linking an inductive bias to a scientific question and by comparing at least two metrics appropriate to the data characteristics.

Given a tuning search space, students can perform cross-validated hyperparameter selection and summarise uncertainty by reporting mean and dispersion across folds.




From a methodological perspective, the central difficulty is not writing code but specifying the inferential claim, the assumptions under which it is defensible and the diagnostics that reveal when those assumptions fail.

Accordingly, each experiment should be accompanied by a record of data provenance, preprocessing choices and metric definitions, because these decisions often dominate model selection effects when datasets are modest in size.

In applied work, it is prudent to treat performance estimates as random variables conditioned on a sampling design; resampling methods and confidence intervals are therefore discussed alongside point estimates.
