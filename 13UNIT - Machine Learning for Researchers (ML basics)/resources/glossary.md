## Terms

**Generalisation**: performance on new data drawn from the same or a related distribution.

**Data leakage**: contamination of training or tuning with information that would not be available at deployment time.

**Cross-validation**: resampling strategy to estimate performance and tune hyperparameters without touching the test set.

**Regularisation**: constraint or penalty that shrinks model complexity to reduce variance.

**Bias–variance trade-off**: qualitative and quantitative relationship between approximation error and estimation variability.

**Dimensionality reduction**: transformation to a lower-dimensional representation, often to denoise or visualise structure.

**Clustering**: unsupervised grouping based on a similarity measure, typically not uniquely determined.




From a methodological perspective, the central difficulty is not writing code but specifying the inferential claim, the assumptions under which it is defensible and the diagnostics that reveal when those assumptions fail.

Accordingly, each experiment should be accompanied by a record of data provenance, preprocessing choices and metric definitions, because these decisions often dominate model selection effects when datasets are modest in size.

In applied work, it is prudent to treat performance estimates as random variables conditioned on a sampling design; resampling methods and confidence intervals are therefore discussed alongside point estimates.
