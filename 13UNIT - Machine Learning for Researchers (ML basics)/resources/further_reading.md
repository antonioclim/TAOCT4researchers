Hastie, Tibshirani and Friedman provide a comprehensive statistical treatment of supervised and unsupervised learning, with careful attention to model selection and evaluation.

Goodfellow, Bengio and Courville emphasise representation learning and modern optimisation perspectives, which are useful when connecting classical models to deep learning practice.

Varoquaux and colleagues discuss pitfalls in cross-validation and the conditions under which evaluation may become optimistic due to leakage or dependency structures.




From a methodological perspective, the central difficulty is not writing code but specifying the inferential claim, the assumptions under which it is defensible and the diagnostics that reveal when those assumptions fail.

Accordingly, each experiment should be accompanied by a record of data provenance, preprocessing choices and metric definitions, because these decisions often dominate model selection effects when datasets are modest in size.

In applied work, it is prudent to treat performance estimates as random variables conditioned on a sampling design; resampling methods and confidence intervals are therefore discussed alongside point estimates.
