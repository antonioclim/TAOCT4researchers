# Self-check — 13UNIT

## Reflection prompts

Identify one place in your pipeline where leakage could occur and describe how the code prevents it.

Describe what would change in your evaluation protocol if the data were time-ordered measurements rather than IID samples.

If two models have similar mean cross-validated performance but different variance across folds, what would you report and why?

Explain how you would communicate model limitations to a domain collaborator who cares about interpretability rather than accuracy.




From a methodological perspective, the central difficulty is not writing code but specifying the inferential claim, the assumptions under which it is defensible and the diagnostics that reveal when those assumptions fail.

Accordingly, each experiment should be accompanied by a record of data provenance, preprocessing choices and metric definitions, because these decisions often dominate model selection effects when datasets are modest in size.

In applied work, it is prudent to treat performance estimates as random variables conditioned on a sampling design; resampling methods and confidence intervals are therefore discussed alongside point estimates.
