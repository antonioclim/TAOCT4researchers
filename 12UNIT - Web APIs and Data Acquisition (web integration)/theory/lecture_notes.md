## Formal notions

We model a client as a stateful program that instantiates a contract between method semantics and representations. Pagination is a successor relation induced by a server-provided link, and correctness includes loop detection as well as termination under a finite resource set.

A retry policy may be described as follows:

```text
attempt := 0
while attempt < K:
  response := GET(url)
  if 200 <= response.status < 300:
     return response
  if response.status in {429, 503}:
     sleep(backoff(attempt))
     attempt := attempt + 1
     continue
  raise PermanentError
raise RetryExhausted
