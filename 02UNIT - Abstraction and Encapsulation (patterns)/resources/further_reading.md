## 💡 Reading Tips

1. **Don't read cover-to-cover**: Use these as references, focusing on relevant sections.
2. **Code along**: Implement examples as you read.
3. **Apply to your research**: Think about how each concept could improve your current projects.
4. **Discuss**: Bring questions to office hours or study groups.
